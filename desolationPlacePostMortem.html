                            <p>                            
								After Desolation Place's development, my team had a post-mortem where we reflected on our experience. Below is a summary of what we discussed.
                            </p>

                            <h2>What Went Well</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The player experience was gradually improved on every sprit, with impactful iterations on UI, gameplay, and player guidance.</li>
                                <li>No scope creep occured within the pod; all features planned and implemented by the player team made it into the final game.</li>
                                <li>The 4 remaining developers on the team felt supported throughout the process; they felt that they were given actionable and quick feedback on their feature implementations.</li>
                                <li>Members felt comfortable communicating with the team lead (Nigel) and collaborating amongst each other on their tasks.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>What Went Wrong/Areas for Improvement</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Due to time constraints, some UI features were developed with no regard for reusability in future studio projects.</li>
								<li>Player audio needs a bit more polish (such as stopping background music when a player is in its death animation).</li>
								<li>One member unexpectedly dropped the project, and became unresponsive to messages from the player team lead
									and studio producer reaching out to him. 
								</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>Lessions Learned</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Ensure that members utilize WolverneSoft Studio's general library of scripts early on in development.</li>
								<li>Encourage members of the studio to develop scripts in a way that can make them reusable in upcoming studio projects.</li>
								<li>For mid-week check-ins, attempt to set up one on one voice chat meetings with members instead of direct messaging. This will
									allow me to get a better sense of each developers working conditions and a better gauge of their progress.</li>
								<li>Reassign tasks to other team members if the current assignee is feeling overwhelmed or runs into a life emergency.</li>

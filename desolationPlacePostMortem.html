                            <h1>Desolation Place Post-Mortem</h1>
                            <p>                            
                            This is a summary of a post-mortem I had with my team at the end of Desolation Place's development. 
                            We reflected on our experience, discussing what we did well as a team and what could have been improved.
                            </p>

                            <h2>What Went Well</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The player experience was gradually improved on every sprit, with impactful iterations on UI, gameplay, and player guidance.</li>
                                <li>No scope creep occured within the pod; all features planned and implemented by the player team made it into the final game.</li>
                                <li>The 4 remaining developers on the team felt supported throughout the process; they felt that they were given actionable and quick feedback on their feature implementations.</li>
                                <li>Members felt comfortable communicating with the team lead (Nigel) and collaborating amongst each other on their tasks.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>What Went Wrong/Areas for Improvement</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>One member unexpectedly dropped the project, and became unresponsive to messages from the player team lead and studio producer reaching out to him. </li>
                                <li>Some features were quickly implemented with no regard for reusability in future studio projects.</li>
                                <li>Player audio needs a bit more polish (such as stopping background music when a player is in its death animation).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>Lessions Learned</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Instead of relying soley on direct messaging, set up virtual one on one check-ins to speak to members on their progress.</li>
                                <li>Ensure that members utilize WolverneSoft Studio's general library of scripts early on in development.</li>
                                <li>Encourage future members of the studio to develop scripts in a way that can make them reused in future studio projects.</li>
                            </ul>

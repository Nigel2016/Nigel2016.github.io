Hello! I am a senior currently studying computer science at the University of Michigan. Throughout my time at Michigan,
I have had the opportunity to take courses in game development, computer security and operating systems. 
I have also developed complex software projects in multidisplinary teams. Recently, in my video game development course,
I collaborated with a team of 5 developers to design and implement an unique video game experience in C# and Unity.

What I love about computer science is that the field gives me the opportunity to work with diverse groups of people to solve
substantial problems. Video game development in particiular has allowed for me to work with students across diverse disciplines 
(music, art, design, and writing) to make interactive experiences that can be enjoyed by everyone. I hope to find work experiences
where I  can collaborate with new people to make software that can be enjoyed by many people.

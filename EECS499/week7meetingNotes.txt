Not just one perlin noise, generates multiple
	each texture is for different reasons
		ex grass perlin
		ex gold perlin
		ex cave perlin?
		ex mountains
		
		spread out but can go very high
		
		stacking perlin noise on each other and have them blend. 
			couple perlin noise sheets. 
				stack structure?
				could be very useful
					some of different sizes that add to each other
					
					and you can get areas of smoothness and feel
					
					shaders: layer different noise patterns to break them up 
					(and cannot recognize patterns)
					
					volitile? useful?
					
		get rid of skybox
		make terrain infinite.

						<h2>Paper Summaries</h2>
						<p> Out of the 24 papers I selected, I filtered out 11 that did not seem important to my topic: automating level design with procedural generation.
							Below, I have selected 3 papers to skim more closely, and summaries.
						</p>
						<p>
						<a href="http://research.gold.ac.uk/17354/"><h3>Automating Game Design In Three Dimensions</h3></a>
						With careful design, procedural generation tools can build complete games from scratch, 
						   with little input from the actual developer. <i>ANGELINA-5</i> is a framework developed by
						   Michael Cook et. al. that can automatically design and build 3D games.
						   The tool employs computation evolution, a family of algorithms inspired by biological evoluation and artifical intelligence.
						   Overall, there are 4 core evoluionary processes which <i>ANGELINA-5</i> is built upon:
						   <ul>
							   <li>Level Design: forming the basic layout of the game world.</li>
							   <li>Zoning: visual and aural astetics of regions in the game world.</li>
							   <li>Placement: The start position of the player, entites as well as the position of the level exit.</li>
							   <li>Ruleset: The behaviors that govern what each entity is allowed to do in the game world.</li>

						   </ul>
						</p>

						<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8519669&tag=1"><h3>Autonomous Tools in System Design: Reflective Practice in Ubisoftâ€™s Ghost Recon Wildlands Project</h3></a>
						 Autonomous (procedural generated) Tools can allow for game designers to generate complex assets for games which would be nearly impossible for someone to do by hand.
							These tools utilize many systems under the hood, such as AI, machine learning, and evolutionary algorithms. However, these tools need to be 
							carefully developed so that designers can best benefit from them. The paper defines 3 major requirements for any autonomous tool:

						   <ul>
							   <li>Scale: Be highly scalable (take on more complex assignments) as a designer's tasks grow in size and complexity.</li>
							   <li>Iteration: The tool must allow for a designer to quickly experiment with alternate versions of the game, and permit them to test different combinations of game elements</li>
							   <li>Creativity: Tools empower creativity by automating repetitive tasks, allowing designers to focus on tasks which require genuine human judgement.</li>
						   </ul>

						   Moreover, Designers must be conscious of their tools design and capabilitites. Autonomous tools are only as good as the designers who create them;
						   developers must actively improve upon the tools and master their usage. By doing this, the designers of <i>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands</i>
						   were able to utilize autonomy to rapidly develop a large scale open world based on Bolivia.

							Tangra is a protoype design tool built for creating 2D platformers. It is a mixed-initiative tool: the designers can place general constraints 
							on a level generation, and the tool can fill in the rest of the geometry. Tangra guarantees that the levels it creates are playable by organizing
							geometry features in what are called "beats". Each beat will contain geometry and entity placements to add gameplay to the level. When combining the beats,
							the tool uses AI to check their placements against constraints specified by the user, as well as ensuring that the end of one beat can be attached to the 
							start of another. Overall, the tool's mixed-initiative approach is ideal for level designers; it gives them enough features to build and augment their levels without
							the system overriding their changes.

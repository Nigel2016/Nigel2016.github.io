                        <p> For this week, I fixed several bugs with the tool and demo'd my project with a stakeholder. In addition, I ran into a roadblock with the Unity Engine that prevented me
                            from implementing an export feature.

                        <h2>Export (3 hours)</h2>
                        <p>
                            One of the features are wanted for the tool was the ability to export user meshes to an external file format. I tried 2 formats: obj and fbx. Obj format does not work well
                            since it stores no information regarding a meshes materials to the file; only physical information such as the list of verticies to construct the mesh. Given this, FBX format
                            is ideal. Unity has an FBX export package that works nicely. However, I ran into two additional issues:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Whenever I attempted to export the mesh during play mode in the Unity editor, the plane generated would be missing its materials. I believe this issue is due to file serialization:
                                    the FBX exporter may be using the underlying files on the game objects to generate the mesh. This means that any modifcations during play mode (such as the material information) 
                                    may not be written to disk. The exporter works fine outside of runtime however.  
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    When I attempted to use another FBX exporter tool, which supports runtime mesh conversion, webGL ran into an issue discribed below:
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <img src="../images/ProceduralGeneration/Week12/webGLIssue.png" alt="Code Snippet" style="width:100%;height:auto;">

                            The tool is having an issue finding a path to write the .fbx file to. After looking up the issue, I discovered that WebGL has no means to interface with the user's local file system. This means that 
                            saving the mesh to any file system is not possible with WebGL alone. To resolve this, I would have to either write my own file system interface, or look into writing javascript code on the server side
                            to enable this functionality. However, with my final presentaiton coming up in a few days, this is not feasible. The export feature will have to be tabled for now. 

                         </p>
                         <h2>Bug Fixes (3 hours)</h2>
                         <p>
                            Signficant time was spent fixing bugs. One issue dealt with the generation of maps. Whenever the user attempts to generate a mesh map
                            without having a color map first, the map becomes blank. To fix this, I added a simple check to verify that a mesh has been generated
                            prior to going into mesh mode. If it has not happened, then the user will be stuck in their current mode, and receive a warning:
                            <style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='../images/ProceduralGeneration/Week12/meshCheck.mp4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

                            Another issue that appeared was that previous custom terrain information was not being cleared when a user switched back to noise mode. 
                            So it was possible that pre-existing custom terrain would effect a new meshes results. I implemented a fix to clear custom terrain entries whenever the user switches back to noise mode:
                            <style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='../images/ProceduralGeneration/Week12/clearTerrain.mp4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>


                            More fixes were made, such as increasing the player's movement speed, and fixing an exception that would sometimes generate when 
                            modes were switched. In addition, I went through all of my previous blog posts, and polished them  (fixing grammar mistakes, adding additional information). I have now exposed links to my blog to my actual website
                            since it is reaching its final stages.

                         <h2>Preparation for Design Expo (1+ hours)</h2>
                         <p>
                             The Design expo takes place on Thursday, December 4th from 5-7pm. During this time, I will need to give a 5-10 minute presentaion on my project.
                             In preparation for this, I created a slideshow and did a mock presentation with one of my stakeholders, Apoorva from Sucker Punch. Overall, feedback on
                             my presentation was positive, with some feedback critiquing my slides and working on better ways to present information on certain slides. For this coming
                             week, I will focus on polishing the slides and practicing my speech.

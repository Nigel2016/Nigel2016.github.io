                        <p>This week, I did research on Market sectors and Relevant companies which my research may fall in. This information can be useful
							for identifying potential audiences and stakeholders that would be interested in my work.
						</p>

						<h2>Relevant Market Sectors</h2>
						<p>
							For this research project, I am investigating how tools powered by procedural generation can be used to automate level design. 
							Given this, it seems that the following markets may be relevant:
							<ul>
								<li>Video Game Industry</li>
								<li>AI (artificiant intelligence is usually necessary for procedural generation)</li>
							</ul>

							As of 2019, the game development industry was "valued at USD 151.55 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach a value of USD 256.97 billion by 2025."(<a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/global-games-market">Mordor Intelligence</a>)
							The industry is composed of thousands of companies, both in the AAA development (Microsoft, Playstation, Nintendo) and independent, small scale, development (Heart Shaped Games, Studio MDHR).
							The AI industry is smaller in market share, but covers a wider range of business applications (Health Care, Robotics, Security). 
							The global market share of AI is on track to reach USD 169,441.8 Million in 2025 (<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/artificial-intelligence-ai-market-size-is-expected-to-reach-usd-169-411-8-million-in-2025-valuates-reports-877658862.html#:~:text=The%20global%20artificial%20intelligence%20in,at%20a%20CAGR%20of%2055.2%25.">Valuates Reports</a>)
						</p>

						<h2>Relevant Companies</h2>
						<p>
							Within the above sections, here are some of the biggest players:
							<p>
								<h3>Sucker Punch Productions</h3> 
								Sucker Punch is a first-party game developer owned by Playstation. Based in Bellevue, WA, the company
								has had hughe success with its recent <i>Ghost of Tushima</i> game for the platstation 4. Their current reported 
								revenue is 31 million dollars (<a href="https://www.zoominfo.com/c/sucker-punch-productions/108937306">zoominfo</a>)
							</p>

							<p>
								<h3>Ubisoft</h3> 
								Ubisoft is a games company based in Montreuil, France. They own several development studios across the world which develop AAA games; most notably, 
								Ubisoft Montreal (Far Cry: New Dawn) and Ubisoft Paris (Ghost Recon: Wildlands). They also a publisher of game as well, working with 3rd part developers to distribute their games.
								As of 2018, the companies revenu was 1.732 billion EUR.									
							</p>

							<p>
								<h3>Nintendo</h3>
								Nintendo is a game development, publisher, and console manufacturer based in Kyoto, Japan.
								Its <i>Nintendo Switch console</i> has recently broken a record: it recorded the highest August dollar sales for 
								a hardware platform in US history this past August (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-switch-records-the-highest-august-dollar-sales-for-a-console-in-us-history/">Video Games Chronicle</a>)
								Its revenue as of 2020 is 1.309 trillion JPY (Google). 	
							</p>
							

							<p>
								<h3>Microsft</h3>
								Microsoft is a multinational technology company based in Redmond, Washington that specializes in 
								computer software, personal computers (powered by Windows OS), and consumer eletronics. Its Xbox division
								is a big player in the game industry, with various first-party and third party partners. It also maintains
								various AI solutions, such as Cortana and the Azure AI playform. Its revenue as 2020 is 
								143 billion USD.
							</p>

							<p>
								<h3>Google</h3>
								Google is a global technology company know for best for its search engine (Google!) and cloud computing services.
								It also owns the <i>Stadia</i> platform, an online video game streaming service competing with the likes of <i>Xbox Game Pass</i>
								and <i>Playstation Now</i>. It also is a huge player in AI/ML computing; Google Brain's TensorFlow product is one of the 
								most popular tools for AI and ML workflows. Google's revenue is curent 38 billion dollars as of the second quarter of 2020 (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/267606/quarterly-revenue-of-google/#:~:text=In%20the%20second%20quarter%20of,Google%20sites%20and%20its%20network.">Satista</a>)
							</p>
						</p>
						<h2>Relevant Products</h2>
						
						<p>
							I also took a look into some procedural generation products that exist within the Game Industry market in particular. Some tools are made 
							with AAA studios and large scale level design in mind. Others are free tools which smaller development teams can take adantage of:
							<p>
								<h3>Ghost of Tsushima</h3>
								An engineer at Sucker Punch Games who worked on <a href="https://www.suckerpunch.com/"><i>Ghost of Tsushima</i></a> was interviewed
								by WolverineSoft over the summer. One of his responsibilies included working on proedural generation tools to
								help automate the creation of the open world. It makes sense that these sorts of tools would be necessary;
								the world of <i>Ghost of Tsushima</i> is so large that it would take a significant amount of time to build by hand.

								<h3>World Creator</h3> 
								<a href="https://www.world-creator.com/">World Creator</a> is a Terrain and Landscape generator that can be used to
								automatically create natural environments in real time. 

								<h3>3D scene Procedural Engine</h3>
								<a href="https://sceelix.itch.io/sceelix">A general purpose tool</a> that can be used to procedurally generate a wide variety of designs (roads, buildings, furniture assets).
								It useds a Node-based language that is visual; unlike text-based scripting, control and logic can be built
								using node structures and graphs. This allows for a designer to more intuitively develop procedural assests
								without being bogged down by semantics of languages like C++ or C#. 

								<h3>World Maker</h3> 
								<a href="https://substandardshrimp.itch.io/world-maker">World Maker</a> Is a 2D tool that can be used to
								automatically generate 2D maps. Once the user specifies some options (map size, number of contienents), the tool will
								quickly build a map poplated with islands, randomized climate, country identifiers (flags), etc. The tool also permits users
								to modify the maps contents once it has been generated. 

								<h3>One Page Dungeon</h3> 
								<a href="https://watabou.itch.io/one-page-dungeon">A free Procedural Generation Tool</a> that can automatically generate 2D dungeons.
								The tool provdes a simple interface and control scheme to modify the resulting maps contents, such as adding/increasing water levels
								and adding secret rooms. It also provide designers with 2 options for exporting the map to their games (png or JSON).

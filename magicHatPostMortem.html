                            <h1>The Magic Hat Post-Mortem</h1>
                            <p>                            
								After The Magic Hat's development, my team had a post-mortem where we reflected on our experience. Below is a summary of what we discussed. 
                            </p>

							<h2>What Went Well</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>The core mechanic (asymmetric co-op between projectile and shield players) required no significant overhauls in its design during development.</li>
								<li>The team was quick to address player feedback, and the game gradually improved for each sprint in its development cycle.</li>
								<li>By using git and code reviews on pull requests, merge conflicts were largely prevented. Also, we were able to detect game-breaking code before it caused issues with our builds. </li>	
							</ul>

                            <h2>What Went Wrong/Areas for Improvement</h2>
                            <ul>
								<li>Playtesters frequently criticized the mapping of controls, often due to poor layout and personal preferences.  </li>	
								<li>Due to budget constraints, the team had to depend on Xbox controllers provided by the course (EECS 494) staff. Due to this, only xbox controller support is guaranteed.</li>
								<li>The team originally intended to implement 9 different boss battles. 
									However, time constraints only allowed us to implement 3 with an acceptable level of polish and bug fixing.</li>		

                            </ul>
							<h2>Lessions Learned</h2>
							<li> Do preliminary research on player controls of other 2D co-op games, then develop a control scheme that the team sticks with throughout development. 
								 Or, add the option to customize controller input if time allows.
							</li>	
							<li>Research ways that input can be handled without having to worry about the type of controller the player uses. </li>
							<li> Keep expectations for the final product realistic with the time constraints provided by the project, 
								 and maintain a small scope for the game at the beginning of development. 
								 Carefully expand the game's scope if its current gameplay is in a good state.
